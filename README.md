# Paddle_Court_2D
This in an ongoing development of an application to map the 2d movements of objects and players on a Padel or Tennis Court.
The pdf file exposures a first draft of the project. (to be continued)
The next step is to implement a network to detect the corners of the court in any possible padel video, to guarentee robustness to the application.
This project was proposed as a conclusion to the discipline of Vision and Cognitive Systems.
